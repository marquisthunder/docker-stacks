Opinionated stacks of ready-to-run Jupyter applications in Docker.

## Quick Start

If you're familiar with Docker, have it configured, and know exactly what you'd like to run, this one-liner should work in most cases:

```
docker run -d -P jupyter/<your desired stack>
```

## Getting Started

If this is your first time using Docker or any of the Jupyter projects, do the following to get started.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) on your host of choice.
2. Open the README in one of the folders in this git repository.
3. Follow the README for that stack.

## A visual overview of stacks

Here's a diagram of the `FROM` relationships between all of the images defined in this project:

## Stacks, Tags, Versioning, and Progress

Starting with [git commit SHA 9bd33dcc8688](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/9bd33dcc8688):

* Every folder here on GitHub has an equivalent `jupyter/<stack name>` on Docker Hub.
* The `latest` tag in each Docker Hub repository tracks the `master` branch `HEAD` reference on GitHub.
* Any 12-character image tag on Docker Hub refers to a git commit SHA here on GitHub. See the [Docker build history wiki page](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/wiki/Docker-build-history) for a table of build details.
* Stack contents (e.g., new library versions) will be updated upon request via PRs against this project.
* Users looking to remain on older builds should refer to specific git SHA tagged images in their work, not `latest`.
* For legacy reasons, there are two additional tags named `3.2` and `4.0` on Docker Hub which point to images prior to our versioning scheme switch.

## Other Tips

* `tini -- start-notebook.sh` is the default Docker entrypoint-plus-command in every notebook stack. If you plan to modify it in any way, be sure to check the *Notebook Options* section of your stack's README to understand the consequences.
* Every notebook stack is compatible with [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.org) 0.5.  When running with JupyterHub, you must override the Docker run command to point to the [start-singleuser.sh](minimal-notebook/start-singleuser.sh) script, which starts a single-user instance of the Notebook server.  See each stack's README for instructions on running with JupyterHub.
* Check the [Docker recipes wiki page](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/wiki/Docker-Recipes) attached to this project for information about extending and deploying the Docker images defined here. Add to the wiki if you have relevant information.

## Maintainer Workflow

**For PRs that impact the definition of one or more stacks:**

1. Pull a PR branch locally.
2. Try building the affected stack(s).
3. If everything builds OK locally, merge it.
4. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-github-key build@docker-stacks.cloudet.xyz`
5. Run these commands on that VM.

```
cd docker-stacks
# make sure we're always on clean master from github
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
# if this fails, just run it again and again (idempotent)
make release-all
```

When `make release-all` successfully pushes the last of its images to Docker Hub (currently `jupyter/all-spark-notebook`), Docker Hub invokes [the webhook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/blob/master/internal/docker-stacks-webhook/) which updates the [Docker build history](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/wiki/Docker-build-history) wiki page.

**When there's a security fix in the Debian base image, do the following in place of the last command:**

Update the `debian:jessie` SHA in the most-base images (e.g., base-notebook). Submit it as a regular PR and go through the build process.

This will take time as the entire set of stacks will rebuild.

**When there's a new stack, do the following before trying to `make release-all`:**

1. Create a new repo in the `jupyter` org on Docker Hub named after the stack folder in the git repo.
2. Grant the `stacks` team permission to write to the repo.
3. Copy/paste the short and long descriptions from one of the other docker-stacks repos on Docker Hub. Modify the appropriate values.
